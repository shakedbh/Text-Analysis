# Text-Analysis

Welcome to the Text Analysis Project! 
This repository contains the code and resources for a multi-stage text classification project that aims to predict the gender of authors based on their written stories.
The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and experimentation with different algorithms and parameters.
